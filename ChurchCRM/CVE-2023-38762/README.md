# CVE-2023-38762 - SQL Injection in /QueryView.php?QueryID=26

## Description
A SQL injection vulnerability in ChurchCRM v.5.0.0 allows a remote attacker to obtain sensitive database information via the friendmonths parameters within the /QueryView.php endpoint. An authenticated attacker can use injection to perform arbitrary SQL queries via POST request with the friendmonths parameter at the /QueryView.php?QueryID=26 endpoint (Recent Friends query). This can be used for information disclosure of anything in the database, including user credentials.
