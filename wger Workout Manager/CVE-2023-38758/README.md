## Description
A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in wger Workout Manager v2.2.0a3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the `license_author` parameter of the `/en/nutrition/ingredient/add/` endpoint. This vulnerability can be exploited when adding a new ingredient or editing an existing one. This targets the application administrator and potentially other users. Anyone can register for a new account and immediately submit a new ingredient for approval. This request is sent directly to the administrator, who triggers the XSS payload as soon as they view the pending request. CSRF (see CVE-2023-38759) can then be used to hijack the administrator's account, as well as any other user's account, and exfiltrate user data.

## Proof of Concept
See wgerPOC.py. This demonstrates CVE-2023-38758 as well as the follow-on CSRF in CVE-2023-38759.
