# CVE-2023-38758 - Cross-Site Scripting (Stored) via Ingredient Feature

## Description
A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in wger Workout Manager v2.2.0a3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the license_author parameter of the /en/nutrition/ingredient/add/ endpoint. This vulnerability when adding or editing an ingredient targets the application administrator and potentially other users. Anyone can register for a new account and immediately submit a new ingredient for approval. This request is sent directly to the administrator, who triggers the XSS payload as soon as they view the pending request. CSRF (see CVE-2023-38759) can then be used to hijack the administrator's account, as well as any other user's account, and exfiltrate user data.

## Proof of Concept
